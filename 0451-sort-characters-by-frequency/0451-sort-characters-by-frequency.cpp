/*
The idea is to use max heap with nodes containing a pair {frequency, character}. Since the first element of the pair is frequency, we don't need to pass a custom comparator. Max heap will be constructed on the basis of frequency of characters, i.e. the root will contain the character with maximum frequency.

Time Complexity: O(n)
O(26log(n)) = O(log(n)) For Construction and extraction from heap
O(n) For storing the frequency in hashmap.
